# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict bank customer churn using various machine learning models. It involves preprocessing the data, exploring different features that might affect the customer churn rate, and building predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of information about bank customers, including demographics, account details, and whether they have churned or not.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
You can view and run the analysis by opening the `Bank_Churn_Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to install the required libraries mentioned above.

## Structure
- `Bank_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and machine learning models.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand the trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that might help in predicting the churn.
4. **Model Training**: Training different machine learning models and selecting the best one.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the selected model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

## Results
The results of the analysis, including the best performing model and insights derived from the data, can be found in the Jupyter Notebook.
